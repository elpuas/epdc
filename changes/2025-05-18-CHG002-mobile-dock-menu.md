# Mobile Dock Menu Implementation

## Description
Created a mobile-only bottom dock navigation menu that appears on screens smaller than 768px width.

## Reason
Improved mobile user experience by providing an easily accessible navigation menu fixed at the bottom of the screen, following mobile app design patterns.

## Files Touched
- `src/components/MobileDock.astro` (new)
- `src/components/Header.astro` 
- `src/styles/Header.module.css`

## Implementation Details
- Added a fixed bottom dock with 5 navigation items displayed as icons with labels
- Used the same navigation links and translated labels as the desktop menu
- Added active state highlighting with accent color (#D8FF00)
- Included proper accessibility features (aria-labels, adequate tap targets)
- Ensured the dock only appears on mobile viewports (max-width: 767px)
- Added padding to the bottom of the body to prevent content from being hidden behind the dock
