    <h1><span class={styles.highlight}>Welcome to</span><br/> ElPuas Digital Crafts</h1>
    <p class={styles.lead}>
      We empower agencies and businesses with pixel-perfect, high-performance websites — built with care, backed by expert support.
    </p>
  </section> 

  <section class={styles.about}>
    <p>We’re ElPuas Digital Crafts — a small, family-led studio founded by <strong>Alfredo Navas</strong> and <strong>Catalina Valverde</strong>, with their son <strong>Gianfranco Navas</strong> now part of the team.</p>
    <p>We’re not a giant agency with layers of meetings and overhead — we’re the kind of team that gets things done, with precision and heart.</p>
    <p>We believe great websites aren’t just beautiful — they’re fast, scalable, affordable, and built to evolve. That’s why we combine creativity, modern tech, and AI-assisted workflows to deliver high-quality websites without the high-maintenance price tag.</p>
    <p>From custom WordPress builds to smart eCommerce platforms, we create digital experiences that help small businesses grow and agencies look good to their clients. And because we’re also developers who’ve seen it all, we think about the long run — speed, SEO, updates, backups, support. The boring stuff that becomes critical when your site goes live.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re a solo founder, a growing brand, or an agency needing a white-label partner, we’ve got your back.</p>
    <p>We build digital crafts for humans — with love, code, and coffee.</p>
    <p>With offices in <strong>Costa Rica</strong>, <strong>Miami</strong>, and <strong>Rome</strong>, we serve clients worldwide — delivering not only bespoke solutions but also <strong>white-label services</strong> to agencies seeking top-tier web development for their clientele.</p>
