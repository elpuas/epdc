Have you heard of *llms.txt*? If not, don't worryâ€”you're in the right place! In this article, we'll break down what it is, what it's for, and why you should consider implementing it on your website.

*Think of it as a treasure map for language agents, not just another robots.txt.*

Since mid-2024, several websites have started incorporating a new file on their servers: `llms.txt`. This file doesn't replace the old robots.txt or sitemaps.xml, but seeks to fulfill a new function: *guiding language models (LLMs) toward the most relevant and high-quality content.*

## What is llms.txt for?

Models like *GPT, Claude, or Gemini* consume text from the web to answer questions or generate content. But unlike a Google bot, they don't need to explore all menus, widgets, or complex structures. `llms.txt` helps them focus on what matters.

In other words: *it defines a curated and optimized version of the content that truly represents your brand.*

## How is it structured?

An `llms.txt` file is simply a plain text file located at the site root (/llms.txt) and has this basic Markdown structure:

- Improves your brand representation in AI-powered tools.

## Risks or criticisms
- Google has indicated it doesn't recognize concrete benefits (*for now*).
- If misconfigured, it could generate duplication or confusion.
- There's no official standard accepted by all LLM engines.

## Should you implement it?

In our opinion, yes. Although it's still in experimental phase, it's an easy way to start controlling how your content is interpreted by AI agents.
