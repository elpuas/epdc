Why your WordPress site needs maintenance (and how ElPuas Digital Crafts solves it for you)

Many businesses think launching a website is a project with an end date. But in reality, a website is like a garden: if you don't take care of it, it fills with weeds, breaks down, and eventually stops bearing fruit. At ElPuas Digital Crafts we see it daily: sites that were launched 1 or 2 years ago and today are slow, outdated, or even infected. That's why we offer web maintenance: so you don't lose what you've already invested and so your site works for you 24/7.

## What happens if you don't maintain your site?
- Compromised security: 4 out of 10 hacked WordPress sites were outdated at the time of infection. 92% of WordPress vulnerabilities come from plugins. And yes, WooCommerce is a very common target.

- Sales loss: A WooCommerce store without maintenance can have checkout failures, payment gateway conflicts, or slowness that makes customers abandon their cart. Just one second of loading delay can reduce conversions by up to 7%.

- SEO and traffic problems: Google penalizes slow or error-prone sites. And if you get infected with malware, your site can end up blacklisted. Recovering from that isn't easy: you can lose up to 95% of organic traffic.
- High recovery costs: If you get hacked or something important breaks, recovering can cost you hundreds (or thousands) of dollars. And worst of all: it can leave you without a site for days. The average time to clean a hacked site is 7.5 days.

## What does our maintenance service at ElPuas Digital Crafts include?
- **Smart updates (WordPress, plugins, and themes)**
Every week we scan your site to detect what needs updating. We use AI-powered tools that alert us to potential incompatibilities before applying changes. We test in staging environments when necessary, and we never update blindly. Our focus: keeping your site up-to-date without breaking it.

- **Automatic backups with instant recovery**
Your files and database are automatically backed up daily or weekly, depending on your plan. If something fails (whether due to human error, plugin, or hack), we can restore your site in minutes, not days. Additionally, we use AI to review error logs and detect anomalies before they escalate.

- **Continuous performance optimization**
We analyze key loading metrics (Core Web Vitals, TTFB, CLS, etc.) and apply improvements where needed: database cleanup, image lazy loading, lighter scripts, better PHP versions. AI helps us identify bottlenecks and suggest automatic improvements before the site becomes slow.

- **24/7 security and uptime monitoring**
Your site is constantly scanned to detect vulnerabilities, modified files, or suspicious access attempts. Our system—with pattern-based and AI detection—can prevent attacks before they affect you. Additionally, if your site goes down, we know before you do and are already working to resolve it.

- **Direct and proactive technical support**
No tickets that take days. You write to us and we respond. But also, we prevent many problems before they happen: AI alerts us if a plugin is abandoned, if something starts consuming more resources, or if a recent update might bring conflicts. This allows us to get ahead and keep your site healthy.

## What do you get with this?
Your site always available and fast: we monitor uptime and performance with intelligent tools. If something fails, we act before you notice.
- Better conversions and more sales: pages that load in < 2s sell more. We optimize for that.
- Better Google ranking: technical performance, speed, and security impact SEO. We help you improve on all those fronts.
- Zero technical stress: you don't have to understand backups, plugin conflicts, or broken versions. We handle it, even before it becomes a problem.
- Constant evolution: we analyze your site with AI, detect improvement opportunities, and notify you. We don't just take care of it, we make it grow.
