For Dr. Adrián Campos, having a simple *blog* was a top priority — he wanted a space to *share trusted information* and guidance with his patients. Combined with the need to present his *physiotherapy services* clearly, we built a lightweight WordPress website that empowers both visibility and credibility.

        ## The Challenge

        Dr. Campos approached us with a clear vision: a *fast, distraction-free website* where he could showcase his range of specialties and publish *educational content for patients*. The site had to be mobile-friendly, easy to update, and load quickly — all while staying within a reasonable budget.

        ## Our Solution

        We built a performance-focused WordPress site powered by a lightweight theme and custom blocks to ensure content flexibility. The blog was carefully structured with categories aligned to his medical focus (e.g., tendinopathy, pain science), enabling intuitive browsing and future SEO growth.

        His homepage highlights his approach and areas of expertise, while the blog acts as a long-term asset for organic visibility and patient trust.
