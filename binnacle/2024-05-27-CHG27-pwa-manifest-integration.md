# PWA Manifest Integration - Task 27

**Date**: 2024-05-27  
**Change ID**: CHG27  
**Feature**: PWA Manifest Support

## Description
Added basic Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities by implementing a Web App Manifest file and linking it correctly in the site's HTML head.

## Reason
Enable the site to be installable as a PWA on supported browsers, improving user experience and engagement by allowing users to install the app on their devices.

## Files Touched
- `public/manifest.webmanifest` (created)
- `public/icons/` (directory created)
- `public/icons/icon-192.png` (placeholder created)
- `public/icons/icon-512.png` (placeholder created)
- `src/components/BaseHead.astro` (modified)

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Web App Manifest
- **File**: `public/manifest.webmanifest`
- **Content**: Complete PWA manifest with:
  - name: "ElPuas Digital Crafts"
  - short_name: "ElPuas"
  - start_url: "/"
  - display: "standalone"
  - background_color: "#000000"
  - theme_color: "#4361ee"
  - orientation: "portrait"
  - lang: "en"
  - icons: 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons

### 2. Created Icons Directory
- **Directory**: `public/icons/`
- **Files**: Placeholder icon files (need proper PNG conversion)

### 3. Updated BaseHead Component
- **File**: `src/components/BaseHead.astro`
- **Change**: Added `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />` to the head section

## Affected Components/Routes
- **Global**: All pages now include the PWA manifest link
- **BaseHead.astro**: Core head component updated

## Validation
- Manifest accessible at `/manifest.webmanifest`
- Site should be installable as PWA in Chrome/Edge
- Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest should show valid configuration

## Next Steps
- Convert placeholder icons to proper PNG format with correct dimensions
- Consider implementing Service Worker for full PWA functionality
- Test installation flow on various devices and browsers

## Technical Notes
- Icons are currently WebP format copied as PNG placeholders
- Proper icon conversion needed for production use
- Manifest follows Web App Manifest specification
