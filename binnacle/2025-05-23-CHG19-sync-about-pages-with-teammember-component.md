# Task 19: Sync Translated About Pages with Final English Version

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Change ID:** CHG19  
**Type:** Content Sync & Component Integration  

## Summary

Synchronized the Spanish (`es/about.astro`) and Italian (`it/about.astro`) About pages with the finalized English version (`en/about.astro`) by implementing the `TeamMember` component and updating content to match the latest structure.

## Reason

The English About page had been updated to use the new `TeamMember` component with improved team member information and updated roles. The Spanish and Italian versions needed to be synchronized to maintain consistency across all language versions while preserving proper translations.

## Files Touched

- `src/pages/es/about.astro` - Updated to use TeamMember component and sync content
- `src/pages/it/about.astro` - Updated to use TeamMember component and sync content
