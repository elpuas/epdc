## Change Description
Removed the old placeholder "crafted-with-love.astro" pages in all three languages, as they have been replaced by the full portfolio section implementation with proper index pages.

## Rationale
After implementing the complete portfolio section with index pages and dynamic routes, the old placeholder pages became redundant and could potentially cause routing conflicts or confusion. Removing them ensures that all traffic to the portfolio section goes to the new implementation.

## Implementation Details

### Files Removed:
- `src/pages/en/crafted-with-love.astro` - English placeholder
- `src/pages/es/crafted-with-love.astro` - Spanish placeholder
- `src/pages/it/crafted-with-love.astro` - Italian placeholder

## Testing Notes
Verified that traffic to `/[lang]/crafted-with-love/` is properly routed to the new index pages and the placeholder pages are no longer accessible.
