# Fix UI Translations

## Description
Fixed issues with UI translations not being applied correctly in Spanish routes.

## What Went Wrong
1. Layout and components were using hardcoded strings instead of translation function
2. Missing translation keys for common UI elements
3. Translation implementation was too complex

## How It Was Resolved
1. Simplified translation approach by using `t()` function directly in components
2. Updated Layout component to use translations for navigation
3. Updated index page to use translations for content
4. Added missing translation keys to both language files

## Files Affected
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro`: Updated to use translations directly
- `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`: Updated to use translations directly
- `src/i18n/utils.ts`: Updated type definitions for new translation keys
- `src/i18n/en.json`: Added new translation keys
- `src/i18n/es.json`: Added new translation keys

## Validation
- Verified Spanish routes show correct translations
- Confirmed navigation items are properly translated
- Checked welcome message appears in correct language
- Validated language switching maintains translations
