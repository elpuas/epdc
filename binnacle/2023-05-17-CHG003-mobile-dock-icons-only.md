# Mobile Dock Icons-Only Implementation

## Description
Created a mobile-only bottom dock navigation menu that displays only icons using astro-icon components.

## Reason
Improved mobile user experience by providing a cleaner, icon-only navigation dock that follows mobile app design patterns while maximizing screen space.

## Files Touched
- `src/components/MobileDock.astro` (updated)
- `src/styles/MobileDock.module.css` (new)

## Implementation Details
- Replaced inline styles with a separate CSS module file
- Used astro-icon/components for icon rendering instead of SVG
- Removed text labels for a cleaner, more app-like interface
- Maintained accessibility with aria-labels
- Ensured appropriate tap target sizes (44x44px) for mobile users
- Styled active navigation items with the accent color (#D8FF00)
- Kept the component responsive (only visible below 768px viewport width)
