## Change Description
Reverted changes that were intended to fix portfolio display issues but inadvertently broke the portfolio functionality.

## Rationale
The changes made to fix the portfolio display issues across languages created new problems with the content collection system and icon integration, requiring a complete reversion to restore functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Files Reverted:
- `src/components/ProjectCard.astro` - Restored the original Icon component implementation
- Removed `src/types.d.ts` - Removed the type definition file that was causing issues
- `astro.config.mjs` - Removed the added arrow-right-bold icon from the configuration

### Changes:
- Restored original icon implementation in ProjectCard.astro
- Removed custom types that were interfering with the content collection system
- Reverted icon configuration changes
