# Terms and Conditions Localization Sync

**Date**: 2024-05-27  
**Change ID**: CHG28  
**Feature**: Terms and Conditions Synchronization

## Description
Synchronized the terms-and-conditions.astro page across all localized versions (English, Spanish, Italian) to ensure structural consistency and correct section numbering.

## Reason
Ensure all language versions of the Terms and Conditions have identical structure, proper section numbering, and consistent content organization for legal compliance and user experience.

## Files Touched
- `src/pages/en/terms-and-conditions.astro` (fixed numbering)
- `src/pages/es/terms-and-conditions.astro` (verified sync)
- `src/pages/it/terms-and-conditions.astro` (verified sync)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed English Version Structure
- **File**: `src/pages/en/terms-and-conditions.astro`
- **Issue**: Had duplicate section "12" (Termination and Force Majeure)
- **Fix**: Corrected numbering sequence:
  - Section 12: Termination
  - Section 13: Force Majeure  
  - Section 14: Governing Law
  - Section 15: Contact
- **Minor Fix**: Removed extra `<p></p>` tag in section 12

### 2. Verified Localized Versions
- **Spanish**: `src/pages/es/terms-and-conditions.astro` - Already properly structured
- **Italian**: `src/pages/it/terms-and-conditions.astro` - Already properly structured
