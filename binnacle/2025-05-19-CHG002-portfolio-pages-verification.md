# Portfolio Pages Translations Verification

## Description
Verified that the portfolio pages and dynamic routes for Spanish (es) and Italian (it) are properly synchronized with the English (en) versions.

## Reason
To ensure consistent structure and user experience across all language versions while maintaining proper translations.

## Files Checked
- src/pages/en/crafted-with-love/index.astro
- src/pages/es/crafted-with-love/index.astro
- src/pages/it/crafted-with-love/index.astro
- src/pages/en/crafted-with-love/[slug].astro
- src/pages/es/crafted-with-love/[slug].astro
- src/pages/it/crafted-with-love/[slug].astro

## Changes
No changes were required as both the index pages and dynamic route pages were already properly synchronized across all languages with correct translations.
